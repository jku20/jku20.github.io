          <legend>A Record of my College App Writing Advice</legend>
          <h3>Why?</h3>
          <p>
            I've had &GreaterEqual; 1 person ask me about undergraduate college applications so I'll put up here a lightly edited version of the big document I wrote to my brother here to point people to. This advice is provide "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the...
            <br><br>
            In all seriousness, this is coming directly out of my brain. It isn't some evidence based method (that doesn't exist), its bunch of words to hopefully spark some ideas and get my brother to start his work.
          </p>
          <h3>What is This Actually A Ramble About?</h3>
          <p>
            The hard part of undergrad college applications (at least here in the US with our silly system) I think is the big personal essay. I feel other stuff is formulaic enough. This is hard because it's basically an ask to generate a magical something out of nothing which somehow will convince some random person a school wants you as a student. Admittedly it's a bit of a silly criteria, but that do be reality. A lot of people try to pick stories which make them look good or show how involved with so many things they are, but really I feel like the task should be read as it is given: <em>it's a creative writing task.</em> The primary goal should be to write a good personal story. Worry about that first. If that story really is good and written in earnest, your voice and portrayal of you will fall out naturally and probably in a better way than trying to force anything.
          </p>
          <h3>Quotes</h3>
          <p>
            Quotes are a cliche starting point. They can work great, but every word of a quote you use is a word you cannot write. 600 words is not a lot, this sentence, think about how little it says, is already nearly twenty words. You get thirty of those. If you use a quote, talk about it, every word, or remove it.
          </p>
          <h3>Ideas</h3>
          <p>
            The hard part of writing is figuring out what to write. Get ideas by just throwing dumb things at the wall and seeing what sticks. It doesn't matter if it's bad. Eventually something might be good. That's just stats. At this stage I much prefer the interpretation of writing not as generating text, but as curating interesting strings of words. You know, like taking out books from the <a href=https://maskofreason.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/the-library-of-babel-by-jorge-luis-borges.pdf>Library of Babel</a> until you find something you like.
            <br><br>
            This means writing a bunch of text. A good rule for this is to wait a week and if you haven't written something good, don't wait for some type of divine intervention, just write anything (Really I feel this is a more general good rule to follow when navigating <em>the human condition</em>. I think the first time someone told this to me was during a math team practice in the context of getting stuck on problems. Either way though, such celestial matters seem too much to be for me to try to write about so I'll cast this digression aside). Something terrible, even if getting out the words is painful in the moment, is better than nothing and will allow more ideas to flow. Editing something bad is much easier than manifesting something out of nothing. You may find while editing, the writing might not even be that bad!
          </p>
          <h3>Essays, Stories and Building Them Up</h3>
          <p>
            Essays are just stories. Maybe a better way to think about it is stories are just essays. Each has something to say and has to support it with clear communication, however you feels is clear. Writing which says nothing is boring.
            <br><br>
            That isn't to say you as the writer will know what you are actually writing about starting out. Get an idea in your head (or don't), write, and then read over everything as a reader and see what it's saying. There's probably a more clear idea in your head about what you are actually talking about now. Then's a better time to pull everything together into a more unified piece. Often I forget to do that last part. It makes things pretty rambly (could you tell?). Though, that's fine too I guess?
          </p>
          <h3>Writing About Yourself</h3>
          <p>
            This is the hardest thing, but also kind of isn't. When you write a character, it is so easy to accidentally just make them like you. Writing to show off your thought process isn't hard, it's just hard to remember nice things about the past to say. But so much of the time, the purpose of writing about yourself is <em>just</em> show off your thought process. It doesn't matter if what you are talking about is boring, or tiny, or even trivially impactful on you. What matters is conveying how you think. You can do that commenting on anything genuinely. It's a bit of a trap trying to think of the best, unique moment. <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE-qmHdZIKU>You are a drop in the bucket of people in the world. Such a unique thing might not even exist.</a> How you think about it is what is special. Trust your brain works in appealing ways. This isn't to say some boring events aren't sometimes actually boring. The idea here is <em>some</em> boring events can be really interesting to read about and there isn't a good way to tell something is interesting or not without actually trying to write about it.
          </p>
          <h3>I'm Still Stuck</h3>
          <p>
            So much of this advice just boils down to "just write more, even if you think it's bad." I do honestly believe that is the best advice, but sometimes it doesn't feel very actionable. Writers block is real. Here's something to try to make progress anyway: Do you have a piece of personal writing you like. It doesn't really matter about what, or what style, or even if it isn't fiction. Copy that! Shamelessly write your own version. Even if you don't use everything you write, it's still something. That's important! Accidentally writing so close to someone else it's unusable is pretty hard, even if the inspiration is obvious. Most things you write are probably not going to be your best work anyway. I look at random blogs I like, but you might have your own thing that you read. If you don't, step one is read more of basically anything.
          </p>
          <h3>But Wait, Aren't There Prompts</h3>
          <p>
            Prompts exist to give you ideas. If they don't help you, write a good essay and pick the prompt it fits most. College essay prompts are really open ended for a reason, I'm sure you can figure out the mental gymnastics to make pretty much any good essay fit one of them.
