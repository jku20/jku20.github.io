# School
I'm in school (the big expensive post-secondary one), which is currently where most of my free time goes. Sometimes I wonder why. I think it's because I try to think of school now like I did high school or middle school or any other school before. The purpose, to me, of school now is different. It is a place for people more so than a place for learning. I believe learning can happen anywhere, with the barrier to resources so low now with the internet. The value of going to a big institution is therefore all of the people in it, professors and students. People are generally very easy to talk to (at least in comparison to the randomly in the wild).

Though I find this shift of mindset hard. Maybe it's because I've had it drilled into me for so long that a school should primarily be a place to learn and only now is that what it can be. I guess it was easier in secondary schools to simply finish the learning that needed to be done and not have to worry about it when it came to the socialization. Now there is a very clear choice between the two, and I need to choose both. 

This is sometimes a false dichotomy and even when it is not, the logic is a cynical way of considering the reality. The choice should be obvious, to chose the fleeting people.
