In a world with black eyes, dark circled dots where a pupil and iris should be, a normal white eye looks so odd. It is comforting as a piece of friendly normalcy in an otherwise scarily bleak world. There is an immediate human attachment for there is finally something physically relatable, even if the white eye is attached to something inhuman. 

Putting black eyes in humans around the inhuman white eye then makes the black eyes, and thus the possessing humans, seem lifeless: tired. I find it sad and fearful to see humans as such, and yet so often it is the case I see, or even seek it out.
