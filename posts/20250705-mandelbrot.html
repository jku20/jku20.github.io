            <p>Writing down a mandelbrot recipe from my grandmother so I remember it. It currently just lives in an email. I've also added salt, because I like salt.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>3 eggs</li>
              <li>1 cup neutral oil</li>
              <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla</li>
              <li>1 cup sugar</li>
              <li>3 cups flour</li>
              <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
              <li>1 teaspoon salt (maybe a bit less, to your taste)</li>
              <li>1 cup chocolate chips</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <p>
            Beat eggs in a large bowl. Then add oil, sugar, and vanilla and mix until homogeneous.
            </p>
            <p>
            Mix flower, baking powder, and salt. Slowly mix this into the liquids until it forms a sticky dough. Stir in chocolate chips.
            </p>
            <p>
            Refrigerate for 2 hours, more or less, until it stops being as sticky and is easier to work with.
            </p>
            <p>
            Preheat oven to 350&#x2109. Put parchment paper on a baking sheet and use a spoon and hands to make two logs of dough on the paper. Sprinkle sugar on their tops. Bake for 25-30 mins, until the tops are just beginning to brown.
            </p>
            <p>
            Wait for the logs to cool a tiny bit and then slice diagonally. Put back in oven for 10 to 15 minutes until crisp. Wait for it to cool! They may not be crispy right out of the oven!
            </p>

            I made these with evoo and honey because that is what I had. I also didn't cut diagonally. Such shame :(. I put them in for 27 minutes and let them cool for 10 minutes before cutting. Then I finished them in the oven for 15 minutes. They were let cool overnight!!!
