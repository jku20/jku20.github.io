              A piece of writing from 2021. I titled it back then too with exactly that casing.
              <br><br>
              "Hey, keep up, we've got to get back to the ship. 
              <br><br>
              Wait, what are you doing? 
              <br>
              Why did you stop? 
              <br><br>
              This place is leaving any second, in a big flash of light I'd bet, off to a far away time.
              <br><br>
              I don't know about you right now, but I want to get back to the guild...
              <br><br>
              Wait, what is that light.
              <br>
              Are you ok?
              <br><br>
              Did one of them get you, they are magical creatures of time and space; they could do this.
              <br><br>
              No, that couldn't be it.
              <br><br>
              They said, they'd let us go. 
              <br>
              You talked to them, you know.
              <br><br>
              They could have flashed us away in a moment and yet we are here.
              <br>
              It couldn't be them...
              <br><br>

              Does it hurt?
              <br>
              Does it feel warm?
              <br>
              Does it feel like anything at all?
              <br><br>

              I don't understand... I don't..."
              <br><br>

              "It's okay, I have to go now.
              <br>
              Don't cry."
            </p>
        </fieldset>
