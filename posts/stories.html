            <legend>After the Night is Over</legend>
            <p>
                Remember in the night the people all around. The loud fills the quiet around the room with chatter, gossip, and all the conversations that so many find so hard during the day. In the background a television plays a slow game of baseball. The Cubs are loosing.
                It all drowns out any thoughts, the wave of the world pushing in on the skull, eroding the failing membrane separating whats internal and external. Everyone is talking over a dinner of chicken strips and fries. 
                <br><br>
                I don't really remember leaving. I talked to a friend I just met and suddenly was home. Isn't time's flexiblility fun? Maybe it was a little healing time for the brain to bring back the ever present monolgue running through anything and everything all at once.
                Thoughts bouncing off the inner side of the mind into an unordered messy pool. Always first about the night. A little list of everyone present. It's little because it could never be complete. A halfway catagorization of each one with what they said and all the different meanings.
                All before the half decade old memories of people long forgotten, walking up to a stranger to ask the simplest of questions for the strangest reasons. Yet more the little ways everyone differed their doubts and the static noise internal to both ears. 
                <br><br>
                It's a lot to keep in mind but like I have much choice in the matter.
                <br><br>
                -- Me coming back from a party one night.

              A piece of writing from 2021. I titled it back then too with exactly that casing.
              <br><br>
              "Hey, keep up, we've got to get back to the ship. 
              <br><br>
              Wait, what are you doing? 
              <br>
              Why did you stop? 
              <br><br>
              This place is leaving any second, in a big flash of light I'd bet, off to a far away time.
              <br><br>
              I don't know about you right now, but I want to get back to the guild...
              <br><br>
              Wait, what is that light.
              <br>
              Are you ok?
              <br><br>
              Did one of them get you, they are magical creatures of time and space; they could do this.
              <br><br>
              No, that couldn't be it.
              <br><br>
              They said, they'd let us go. 
              <br>
              You talked to them, you know.
              <br><br>
              They could have flashed us away in a moment and yet we are here.
              <br>
              It couldn't be them...
              <br><br>

              Does it hurt?
              <br>
              Does it feel warm?
              <br>
              Does it feel like anything at all?
              <br><br>

              I don't understand... I don't..."
              <br><br>

              "It's okay, I have to go now.
              <br>
              Don't cry."
