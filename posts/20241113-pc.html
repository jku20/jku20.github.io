                Welcome!<br><br>
                This is the portal that leads to an inhabited world. Ignore the many other portals which lead to empty worlds. Through here, many adventures and new experiences await your arrival.<br><br>
                But, before you enter, I need you to answer a few questions. Please, be truthful. Now, ready? Let the questions begin.<br><br>
                Do you like going to the beach?
              </i>                            
              <br><br>
              No.
              <br><br><i>
                You stub your toe while getting a chair for a friend. What do you do?
              </i><br><br>
              I pretend my toe doesn't hurt.
              <br><br><i>
                You are getting ice cream. Everyone gets vanilla, but you want chocolate. What do you get?
              </i><br><br>
              Chocolate!
              <br><br><i>
                Walking through a door you see a person far behind you. What do you do?
              </i><br><br>
              Hold the door for them.
              <br><br><i>
                Have you ever heard someone say your name even though no one did.
              </i><br><br>
              Yes...
              <br><br><i>
                Your best friend eats the last of the cookies you two are sharing. How do you feel?
              </i><br><br>
              Arghaaaaa!
              <br><br><i>
                Boooo! Did I scare you?
              </i><br><br>
              Maybe a little...
              <br><br><i>
                Do you ever go to resturants alone?
              </i><br><br>
              No.
              <br><br><i>
                Do you want me to ask any more questions?
              </i><br><br>
              No.
              <br><br><i>
                Thank you for answering the questions. Now I'll analyze your aura. This is the energy every living thing radiates just by being alive. Relax. Take a deep breath... Now exhale.
                <br><br>
                Ah. Purple.
                <br><br>
                You are shy, yet bold and loyal. You like to listen to people. Sometimes you worry about small things even when they don't matter. Don't be so nervous. Around people you know well, you talk more, speaking your mind. People trust you and in return you always do your best for your friends.
                <br><br>
                Yes...
                <br><br>
                Now, who do you wish to be your partner?
