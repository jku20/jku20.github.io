              <i>
                Welcome!<br><br>
                You're from The City right? This is the portal that leads to an another world. Through here, many adventures and new experiences await your arrival.<br><br>
                But, before you enter, I need you to answer a few questions. Please, be truthful. Now, ready? Let the questions begin.<br><br>
                Do you like going to the beach?
              </i>                            
              <br><br>
              No.
              <br><br><i>
                You stub your toe while getting a chair for a friend. What do you do?
              </i><br><br>
              I pretend my toe doesn't hurt.
              <br><br><i>
                You are getting ice cream. Everyone gets vanilla, but you want chocolate. What do you get?
              </i><br><br>
              Chocolate!
              <br><br><i>
                Walking through a door you see a person far behind you. What do you do?
              </i><br><br>
              Hold the door for them.
              <br><br><i>
                Have you ever heard someone say your name even though no one did.
              </i><br><br>
              Yes...
              <br><br><i>
                Your best friend eats the last of the cookies you two are sharing. How do you feel?
              </i><br><br>
              Arghaaaaa!
              <br><br><i>
                Boooo! Did I scare you?
              </i><br><br>
              Maybe a little...
              <br><br><i>
                Do you ever go to restaurants alone?
              </i><br><br>
              No.
              <br><br><i>
                Do you want me to ask any more questions?
              </i><br><br>
              No.
              <br><br><i>
                Thank you for answering the questions. Now I'll analyze your aura. This is the energy every living thing radiates just by being alive. Relax. Take a deep breath... Now exhale.
                <br><br>
                Ah. Purple.
                <br><br>
                You are shy, yet bold and loyal. You like to listen to people. Sometimes you worry about small things even when they don't matter. Don't be so nervous. Around people you know well, you talk more, speaking your mind. People trust you and in return you always do your best for your friends.
                <br><br>
                Yes...
                <br><br>
                Now, who do you wish to be your partner?

              "Ow! What are you doing. Wait, don't hit me. I'm not going to hurt you, I promise." 
              <br><br>
              The hit came from the hand of a thin boy in a short sleeved white shirt. He was leaning over another boy in a tan shirt, who had fallen to the ground. 
              <br><br>
              "Huh? Oh, you're not wild. You must have gotten lost in Mystic Forest. Uhhh, come with me, I'll get you out of here. It shouldn't be much further out."
              <br><br>
              <i>Mystic Forest? It just looks like a regular, grassy clearing, maybe with a few knotted trees.</i>
              <br><br>
              "Do you need help getting up?"
              <br><br>
              <i>Wait, where am I how did I get here. What do I remember? Okay, I am from The City. What's my name? Ahh, I don't remember...</i>
              <br><br>
              "I hit you pretty hard... You look a little, uh, unstable."
              <br><br>
              "Yeah, I could use a hand."
              <br><br>
              The boy in the white shirt extended a hand and pulled the boy in the tan shirt to his feet. He looked up and saw the blue cloudless sky he'd seen before. In front of him was the knotted trees the boy had seen from the ground. To boy looked to his left and right. It was no clearing. The path he had found himself in was a long cleared strip of grass surrounded by an impassably dense forest. On the left, it looked like there might be a boxy turn. Looking ahead again, the knots of dark bark suddenly seemed to shimmer and sway in front of him as the wind passed by. The boy shivered and started to feel the sore on the side of his arm.
              <br><br>
              "First time in the forest? It takes a little getting used too. Feeling a bit better?" 
              <br><br>
              "Yeah."
              <br><br>
              "Great! Still, take my hand until your arm feels totally better. It'll be fast, people heal faster walking in wittesefs."
              <br><br>
              The strange word didn't even register to the tan shirted boy. He still felt weak and could barely grasp the other boy's hand. The other boy make sure to hold his hand tight.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
              "So, do you feel a bit better now? I don't mind holding onto you, but if we come across a particularly mean wild, I'd like to know you can run back while I fight it."
              <br><br>
              "I think I can," said the tan shirted boy, wondering what a "wild" was but being afraid to ask.
              <br><br>
              The two walked for a couple minutes in quiet, turning right at the end of the pathway, only to find the tree growth around it quickly thickened until it seemed there was no clearing at all.
              <br><br>
              "Dead end, turn around" said the white shirted boy said with a sigh. "I don't think it'd be a good idea to try and push further through there. We'd just get lost."
              <br><br>
              The two started walking back before the white shirted boy stopped.
              <br><br>
              "I forgot to ask your name!" he said. "Sorry, my name is Rio, what's yours?"
              <i>Think, think. Still nothing is coming to mind.</i>
              "I don't remember. The last thing I remember is waking up in the forest."
              <br><br>
              Rio's face shifted to a confused frown. "You don't remember anything else?"
              <br><br>
              "The only thing I remember is I'm not from this world. I'm from The City. I was sent here, or maybe chose to go here, I don't know."
              <br><br>
              "Huh. I've never heard of that before. Well, I hate to break it to you, but this is most certainly not The City, though I guess there are way worse places you could have ended up," Rio said with a chuckle. "The City... I thought all of them were supposed to have left Waleira long ago. I know it still exists; I've heard of a small few people traveling there. But never, people coming back."
              <br><br>
              Rio looked off into the distance for a second before suddenly recomposing himself.
              <br><br>
              "Such a tangent," he said. "Your name! People often name themselves after where they are born. I was named 'Rio' after an old currency whose metal was mined in my hometown. I know you don't remember your name form The City, but you are in Waleira now. You should have a Waleiran name."
              <br><br>
              "A Waleiran name? I don't know how I'd make sometime out of Mystic Forest. You've met other people from Mystic Forest before right? What's a common name for them?"
              <br><br>
              "Actually, you are the first person I've met."
              <br><br>
              "Still choose something. I just need ideas. Making names is hard. I'll tell you how much I like it."
              <br><br>
              "Ahh, so much pressure. Asking me to choose your name. What seems right for you..." Rio said trailing off in thought.
              <br><br>
              "Oh, that's pretty! Yew, like the tree? Because you found me in the forest? So cool! I like it. Great, I'm Yew, nice to meet you," the tan shirted boy said sticking out his hand.
              <br><br>
              Rio sighed and then put on a smile. "Nice to meet you," he said.
