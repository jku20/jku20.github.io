              <i>
                Welcome!<br><br>
                You're from The City right? This is the portal that leads to an another world. Through here, many adventures and new experiences await your arrival.<br><br>
                But, before you enter, I need you to answer a few questions. Please, be truthful. Now, ready? Let the questions begin.<br><br>
                Do you like going to the beach?
              </i>                            
              <br><br>
              No.
              <br><br><i>
                You stub your toe while getting a chair for a friend. What do you do?
              </i><br><br>
              I pretend my toe doesn't hurt.
              <br><br><i>
                You are getting ice cream. Everyone gets vanilla, but you want chocolate. What do you get?
              </i><br><br>
              Chocolate!
              <br><br><i>
                Walking through a door you see a person far behind you. What do you do?
              </i><br><br>
              Hold the door for them.
              <br><br><i>
                Have you ever heard someone say your name even though no one did.
              </i><br><br>
              Yes...
              <br><br><i>
                Your best friend eats the last of the cookies you two are sharing. How do you feel?
              </i><br><br>
              Arghaaaaa!
              <br><br><i>
                Boooo! Did I scare you?
              </i><br><br>
              Maybe a little...
              <br><br><i>
                Do you ever go to restaurants alone?
              </i><br><br>
              No.
              <br><br><i>
                Do you want me to ask any more questions?
              </i><br><br>
              No.
              <br><br><i>
                Thank you for answering the questions. Now I'll analyze your aura. This is the energy every living thing radiates just by being alive. Relax. Take a deep breath... Now exhale.
                <br><br>
                Ah. Purple.
                <br><br>
                You are shy, yet bold and loyal. You like to listen to people. Sometimes you worry about small things even when they don't matter. Don't be so nervous. Around people you know well, you talk more, speaking your mind. People trust you and in return you always do your best for your friends.
                <br><br>
                Yes...
                <br><br>
                Now, who do you wish to be your partner?

              "Ow! What are you doing. Wait, don't hit me. I'm not going to hurt you, I promise." 
              <br><br>
              The hit came from the hand of a thin boy in a short sleeved white shirt. He was leaning over another boy in a tan shirt, who had fallen to the ground. 
              <br><br>
              "Huh? Oh, you're not wild. You must have gotten lost in Mystic Forest. Uhhh, come with me, I'll get you out of here. It shouldn't be much further out."
              <br><br>
              <i>Mystic Forest? It just looks like a regular, grassy clearing, maybe with a few knotted trees.</i>
              <br><br>
              "Do you need help getting up?"
              <br><br>
              <i>Wait, where am I how did I get here. What do I remember? Okay, I am from The City. What's my name? Ahh, I don't remember...</i>
              <br><br>
              "I hit you pretty hard... You look a little, uh, unstable."
              <br><br>
              "Yeah, I could use a hand."
              <br><br>
              The boy in the white shirt extended a hand and pulled the boy in the tan shirt to his feet. He looked up and saw the blue cloudless sky he'd seen before. In front of him was the knotted trees the boy had seen from the ground. To boy looked to his left and right. It was no clearing. The path he had found himself in was a long cleared strip of grass surrounded by an impassably dense forest. On the left, it looked like there might be a boxy turn. Looking ahead again, the knots of dark bark suddenly seemed to shimmer and sway in front of him as the wind passed by. The boy shivered and started to feel the sore on the side of his arm.
              <br><br>
              "First time in the forest? It takes a little getting used too. Feeling a bit better?" 
              <br><br>
              "Yeah."
              <br><br>
              "Great! Still, take my hand until your arm feels totally better. It'll be fast, people heal faster walking in wittesefs."
              <br><br>
              The strange word didn't even register to the tan shirted boy. He still felt weak and could barely grasp the other boy's hand. The other boy make sure to hold his hand tight.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
              "So, do you feel a bit better now? I don't mind holding onto you, but if we come across a particularly mean wild, I'd like to know you can run back while I fight it."
              <br><br>
              "I think I can," said the tan shirted boy, wondering what a "wild" was but being afraid to ask.
              <br><br>
              The two walked for a couple minutes in quiet, turning right at the end of the pathway, only to find the tree growth around it quickly thickened until it seemed there was no clearing at all.
              <br><br>
              "Dead end, turn around" said the white shirted boy said with a sigh. "I don't think it'd be a good idea to try and push further through there. We'd just get lost."
              <br><br>
              The two started walking back before the white shirted boy stopped.
              <br><br>
              "I forgot to ask your name!" he said. "Sorry, my name is Rio, what's yours?"
              <i>Think, think. Still nothing is coming to mind.</i>
              "I don't remember. The last thing I remember is waking up in the forest."
              <br><br>
              Rio's face shifted to a confused frown. "You don't remember anything else?"
              <br><br>
              "The only thing I remember is I'm not from this world. I'm from The City. I was sent here, or maybe chose to go here, I don't know."
              <br><br>
              "Huh. I've never heard of that before. Well, I hate to break it to you, but this is most certainly not The City, though I guess there are way worse places you could have ended up," Rio said with a chuckle. "The City... I thought all of you were supposed to have left Waleira long ago. I know it still exists; I've heard of a small few people traveling there. But never, people coming back."
              <br><br>
              Rio looked off into the distance for a second before suddenly recomposing himself.
              <br><br>
              "Such a tangent," he said. "Your name! People often name themselves after where they are born. I was named 'Rio' after an old currency whose metal was mined in my hometown. I know you don't remember your name form The City, but you are in Waleira now. You should have a Waleiran name."
              <br><br>
              "A Waleiran name? I don't know how I'd make sometime out of Mystic Forest. You've met other people from Mystic Forest before right? What's a common name for them?"
              <br><br>
              "Actually, you are the first person I've met."
              <br><br>
              "Still choose something. I just need ideas. Making names is hard. I'll tell you how much I like it."
              <br><br>
              "Ahh, so much pressure. Asking me to choose your name. What seems right for you..." Rio said trailing off in thought.
              <br><br>
              "Oh, that's pretty! Yew, like the tree? Because you found me in the forest? So cool! I like it. Great, I'm Yew, nice to meet you," the tan shirted boy said sticking out his hand.
              <br><br>
              Rio sighed and then put on a smile. "Nice to meet you," he said.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
              The two started walking again, Yew following Rio, quietly repeating his new name. When they had reached the spot of the path where Yew had first woken up, he realized his arm no longer hurt and he let out a small smile. The two walked the other direction, turning right at another oddly sharp corner and hitting a fork in the path. It was another rectangular clearing threaded through the forest perpendicular to the path the Yew and Rio walked on. Rio had come from the area straight ahead and they had just come from a dead end so they followed the other fork. Walking for a few minutes, Yew realized all the trees had begun to blend together. They all looked the same. He could barely remember which way he came from as they walked. Then Yew noticed how quiet it seemed in the forest. There were neither insects nor animals roaming through the trees, just him and Rio and the occasional gust of wind.
              <br><br>
              The pair turned another sharp corner in the path and at the end saw a set of white stares sitting in a larger clearing. Yew couldn't make out where they lead to, but they seemingly went up a little bit into the sky before getting obscured by a cloudy fog. 
              <br><br>
              "Look," Rio said, "those stairs are our way out."
              <br><br>
              "Cool," said Yew.
              <br><br>
              <i>How strange,</i> he thought. <i>They looks so out of place. Maybe that's why this place is called Mystic Forest. Wait, is that...</i>
              <br><br>
              "Look out, there is a person over there. It looks like it's waiting for us!"
              <br><br>
              "Huh?"
              <br><br>
              A small child pounced from behind a tree. Yew found her body and face difficult to focus on, losing the form for a second when he tried. She let out a scream, "morus o mora," which seemed to resonate through the forest in a shrill tone and her eyes narrowed in a squint as she ran towards Rio running long dirty looking nails deep into his flesh. As the skin and meat separated, the it seemed to rot in place and Rio flinched reaching into his pocket with his other hand, his rotting arm hanging limp. 
              <br><br>
              <i>No, Rio!</i>, thought Yew. With it, came a fierce rage which seemed to perpetuate every other thought in his head. It cleared his mind, and with it any fear of the girl was replaced by a primal urge to <i>protect Rio</i> and <i>kill her</i>. Yew began running, forwards, towards the girl, his strides seeming to extend with every step, as they were with white bone pushing through the bottom of his feat, growing to extend Yew's height. He towered over the girl when reaching Rio and found his skull extended through his skin to form a misshapen lizard maw as he bit down with a crunch on the girl's head. He pulled her off the ground and flung her into the trees using the new strength in his head an neck. The girl landed with a loud thud against a tree, rattling loose some bark falling on her unmoving body. Yew took a stilted breath, and as he did the mutilated bone and flesh on his face melted back into its original form, reforming into the boy Rio had found.
              <br><br>
              With the girl unmoving, Yew's rage subsided and he his thoughts turned to the horror of the situation. <i>Did I just kill the girl</i>, he thought. He was petrified, and forgot the reason for the idea until he heard, "Hey, Yew!" The painful squint in Rio's eyes was gone. He looked as healthy as before, nibbling on a pinked dotted berry as he spoke. "Don't worry about your heads up. The wild would have tried to attack us regardless."
              <br><br>
              "Is the girl going to okay."
              <br><br>
              "Oh, it's just knocked out. The wittesef will heal it, as it does for all of the wilds. They live here, decorating and populating the paths, fending off invaders like us. I guess the care, or in some cases reincarnation, is like a little gesture of thanks from the wittesef. It's kind of crazy how much energy these things have. Great job fending it off by the way. Forget running, looks like you're a natural at battling!"
              <br><br>
              "Yeah, thanks... again. Is your hand going to be okay? The poison looked like it was taking hold."
              <br><br>
              "I'll be fine. I always being a couple bat berries when going to this forest. They'll take care of the scratch, and anything else the wittesef will take care of. We heal faster in here too, though I don't really know a reason for that one. Maybe we make its life a bit more interesting? Anyway, we should get to the stairs now. The way looks clear."
              <br><br>
              Yew was still a bit uneasy, taking another glance at the corpse laying against the tree, but knew nothing else to do than to trust Rio's confidence. 
              <br><br>
              "Okay, let's go."
