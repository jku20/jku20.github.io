            <p>A long while ago I had a writing pad where I'd write little stories. Often they sounded more like excerpts of stories than complete pieces of their own though. I found them quite nice to read so will run an experiment of doing a similar thing digitally, linked <a href="posts/stories.html">here</a>.</p>
