            <p>I had a friend ask me why Purple Crawlers needed to be a Pokemon Mystery Dungeon fanfiction. He had a point. It will continue as an original work <a href="posts/20241113-pc.html">here</a>! The first chapter has been rewritten.</p>

            <p>Is writing a Pokemon Mystery Dungeon fanfiction cool yet? I don't know, but I think I might try it. High quality writing is explicitly a non-goal, but if you want to read it, take a look <a href="posts/20240715-pmd-pc.html">here</a>!</p>

            <p>A long while ago I had a writing pad where I'd write little stories. Often they sounded more like excerpts of stories than complete pieces of their own though. I found them quite nice to read so will run an experiment of doing a similar thing digitally, linked <a href="stories.html">here</a>.</p>
