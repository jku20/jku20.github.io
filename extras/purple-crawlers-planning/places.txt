# Places
## Towns
Ironville: Pretty big and has a bunch of other stuff in it. Is generally centered around mining, but has expanded past that to also be a big merchant
town. There area lot of different types of pokemon coming in an out now, but traditionally it's been fighting, rock, ground, and steal types. Much of
the architecture is built out of stone and rocks, with some built into the mountains area near by.

Notably this is Rio's home town.

River Town: The town houses are shaped a bit like pokemon. There is one in the shape of a hoppip. It is just south of Towside Meadown built on a river.

## Places of Note
Townside Meadow: This is a clearing near River Town. It was common for pokemon to come and play and the occasional events were held there. However, much
of the town now avoids it because of its close proximity to Mystic Forest. Still people go, but all the children are told the scary story: 

once upon a time, not so long ago
there was a deerling, a little doe
who ventured past the meadow's ring
following a hoppip on the wind's flow
"such a nice walk" she said, her voice a sing
her hooves hitting rocks with a ping.

so she ventured on for hours
a little quest from flowers to flowers
amongst her sides, the trunks of trees
grew above her as giant towers
a maze around with bugs and bees
until the doe could not feel at ease

lost in the forest alone in the wild
she heard the cry of a little child
she ran to it to see the worry
to find the scene, a mess of dirt piled
an next to it cut down in a hurry
the stump of a tree with red eyes blurry

the stump shrieked lowder rustling leaves
away ran the deerling, faster than the breeze
until she couldn't run any more
until her breath stopped with a wheeze
there the deerling looking so poor
look around for food, scowered the floor

yet more hours she would look
but came only bugs, nothing to eat or cook
so she went to sleep late that night
on an empty stomach, oh so long it took
that morning she stood up in the light
but then stumbled over for she had no might

never was the doe seen again
trapped in the forest's pen
this is why you must never go
when playing north of the river bend
playing of in the warm meadow
up into the trees where the hoppip blow

South Forest: Forest in the south holding the green base.

Northern Kingdom: This is the kingdom of legend, once ruled by a human king, but now known as the origin of the Dark.

## Mystery Dungeons
Mystic Forest: This is a tiny mystery dungeon (3F) which exists near River Town. It is a tame forest, home to a tame older person troubled because they
were afraid they would not see pokemon again. They are caring, leading to a relatively tame dungeon.

Dark Chasm: This is a mystery dungeon of legend, one of the first and strongest, built of the humans fallen prey (or once masters to) Giratina. At the 
base of this dungeon is a rift to an alternate dimension housing Giratina.
