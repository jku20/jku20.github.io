# General Lore
## High Level Summary
The world, Waleira, is varied in terms of what is in it, but it has the stuff that is good for pokemon.

There used to be humans long long ago but no one really remembers them. More of a legend. They are thought to live elsewhere.
Some pokemon have traveled from human lands but they are few and far between.

Mystery dugeons have been around for a long time, but have slowly become more common.
This isn't known by the pokemon, but mystery dungeons are actually collections of human spirits haunting an area. 
Maybe these can be understood as cursed spiritomb which are maintained by Girantina and a human as places to store troubled spirits.

There have simply been more troubled spirits as of late. 
All is to say, the mystery dungeon problem is a super natural manifistation of terrestrial problems.

Most pokemon live peacfully, however there is "the Dark," a force of pokemon who occassionly and semi-secretely take over towns of pokemon.
These towns end up uniting creating a unified force of these nations. The Dark is really big, like kind of a problem really big.
Everyone knows about the Dark. Most are indifferent, some don't like them, some support and believe in the making them a unified global state.
They tend to do as empires do and take more than their share from the unincorperated towns around them.
The Dark is not inherantly evil though. A maybe evil at its core, but large subsets of it are quite plesent and good.
One pretty unifying part of the Dark, though, is desire to eliminate old human influence. 
It feels a bit hypocritical because the Dark's structure is in many ways more human than pokemon. 
This idea of "the past humans' bad influence" comes from mystery dungeons often harboring in old human places. There is maybe also some motivation from
the higher ups.
Obviously "the Dark" isn't called that by themselves. They call themselves the Silver Hearts (a bit idealistic people, but kind of cool).

There are also scattered groups of dungeon crawlers/explorers/rescuers.
They generally know about each other and help each other when in need, but don't spend a lot of time trying to collaborate.
These groups can be as small as a pair or two of pokemon living on their own to little towns built around this dungeon crawling.
Legends of famous crawlers form a little background and lore unifying these teams. Crawlers generally teach other new crawlers at some point.

Included in the common things they all learn, the crawlers started long ago as groups to explore mystery dungeons and rescuing lost pokemon.
There used to be humans among some of the crawlers, but that has long since passed. The reason why there are no humans is unknown.
Some crawlers blame the Dark for driving them out and being "anti-human." This isn't really backed by much. (oh no, racism on both sides).
Most crawlers are pretty opposed to the Dark though and try to drive them out of where they are or disrupt their existence.
Generally the Dark's desire for unification doesn't really play nice with the distributed nature of the crawlers or general society right then.
The tenents of the crawlers are to understand, or at least not fear and be able to work within, mystery dungeons, and more recently remove the Dark.

The biggest group of crawlers is the Green Base. They are a tight knit group living around the reminents of a stone human temple in a forest. 
Pokemon live in small canopies around the temple, though some leaders and well known crawlers live in the temple. 
Inside and right around the temple are also things like stores and services geared towards crawlers. Also some resturants and things.
This forest temple is like the downtown and town hall of this crawler town. It unifies them and they are all super loyal to it.
Because of this loyalty and long history though, those who are disloyal are "firmly asked to leave." 
This group provides to the surrounding pokemon, but is one of the big leaders against the Dark.

The Dark and crawlers have been in a slow, mostly quite conflict for a long time. There are tales on both sides of battles and heros and enemies.
A big part of the idealogical conflict is the crawlers trying to be more divided as historically the land was and the Dark wanting more centralization.
Either way, it isn't super black and white. Good parts of the Dark and crawlers can get along. Similarly with bad crawlers and the Dark.
Not all crawlers being super unified is one reason why the Green Base is so strict about its loyalty things and being kind of military-ish.
