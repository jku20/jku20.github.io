		<h3> PAGE NOT FOUND </h3>
		<p> 
			<h4>Hello person</h4>
			this means that the page you are looking for doesn't exist. If you are sure you are trying to get to the right link, 
			that means either I have done something horribly wrong or the more likely option, 
			I just haven't finished the part of the site you are trying to get to yet. 
			Check back later and you might find something fixed (or maybe not), thanks for stopping by.
