            <p>Hello, I'm Jeremy Ku-Benjet. I'm on the internet now!</p>
            <p>Maybe you want it a bit more? Uh, I'm currently in school learning about broadly CS and adjacent things. I find a lot of CS things cool but currently most interested in programming languages, compilers, and software engineering.</p> 
            <p>When I'm not doing that, I read a bit, mainly fun short stories, random internet blogs, and boring academic books. I sometimes play guitar (I'm not very good though), or draw, or cook, or write. Those are all fun. One day I'll combine everything and make a video game.</p>
            <p>I'll probably populate this site with projects I feel like writing up or possibly my own ramblings as they come in typical blog style.
