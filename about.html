            <p>Hello, I'm Jeremy. I'm on the internet now!</p>
            <p>Maybe you want it a bit more? Uh, I'm currently in school in New York learning about broadly CS and adjacent things. Programming languages cool! That's fun. (pls hire me)</p> 
            <p>When I'm not doing that, I read a bit, mainly fun short stories (I tend towards fantasy or sci-fi but kind of whatever catches my mind), random internet blogs, and boring academic books. I sometimes strum strings, or draw, or cook, those are all fun. I used to write more but don't now that much.</p>
            <p>I'll probably populate this site with projects I feel like writing up or possibly my own ramblings as they come in typical blog style.
